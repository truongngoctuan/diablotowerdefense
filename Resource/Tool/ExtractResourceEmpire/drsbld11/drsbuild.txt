INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DRSBUILD is a command-line utility for building MS Age of Empires 
data resource (.DRS) files from wave sound (.WAV) files, shape graphics
(.SLP, .SHP) files and various binary (.BIN) files. It supports such
actions as: adding/replacing files in data resource files, deleting
files from data resource files, extracting files from data resource
files and listing files contained in data resource files. The 
command-line interface of DRSBUILD features full wildcards support, 
which means that all actions can be performed on multiple sound, 
graphics and binary files, and target data resource files, and will 
affect only the files matching the specified wildcard arguments.

The primary goal of DRSBUILD is to make possible the creation and use
of AoE modpacks. A "modpack" (modification package) is a set of 
modified graphics, sounds and rules that should replace the standard 
ones and make a game to look and feel differently, while retaining the 
same game engine. Modpacks are available for many of the most popular
games - Civ2, Warcraft, DOOM, Quake, etc. Anybody who has played a good 
modpack knows that by editing the game resources the best game can be 
made even better! I've played many Civ2 modpacks that I loved more than 
the original game, so I feel that the same thing for AoE is a must. 
That's why I decided to write a builder/extractor utility for the AoE 
data resource files. This utility can be used by modpack developers and 
modpack users to achieve an unexpected AoE experience.

Since the graphics & sounds of AoE are packed in data resource (.DRS) 
files, their direct replacement is not possible. Furthermore even if 
somebody invents a way to modify the data resource files by replacing 
some of the files contained within them with other files, he couldn't 
share his work with others without great difficulty, since the data 
resource files of AoE are very large (total size 46.4 MB). Here is where 
comes the need of such an utility like DRSBUILD - with it the extraction, 
modification and replacement of the files embedded in the .DRS files is 
an easy and straightforward task. Modpack developers can experiment with 
every one of the 683 graphics and 144 sounds, as well as with the user 
interface of 24 dialogs, 108 graphics and 17 sounds, by modifying or 
replacing some of them to make specific scenario or campaign more 
attractive or just to let people have fun. After finishing their work, 
they can provide to others only the files they have modified, not the 
whole 45MB resource set. Modpack users on the other hand can put the 
modified files into the data resource files with a single command-line 
invocation of DRSBUILD, or even better by running an install script 
(.BAT file) which makes backup copies of the original .DRS files, 
installs the modpack by invoking DRSBUILD and finally tells the people 
to enjoy and how to restore everything as it was. A sample modpack 
installation script is provided in the file MINSTALL.BAT.

If you are still in doubt if all this can be possible, you can stop
reading for a while, surf to AoE Heaven and download from there
"First Age of Empires Modpack" made with DRSBUILD. This sample modpack
contains 2 new files - 1 graphic for the Egyptian wonder and 1 sound for
the wonder selection. There are also installation/deinstallation scripts
and a sample scenario to test the modpack. After installing it and 
successfully defending your new differently looking and sounding wonder
in the sample scenario, you can continue reading this and other documents
that come with DRSBUILD to see how it was created and how you can create 
your own modpacks, much better than this, or use modpacks created by others.

Here we come to the bad news. You can't edit the graphics files 
(.SLP and .SHP) even extracted from the .DRS files - their format is 
proprietary to ES and is too complicated to be dug out by hackers. There 
are no utilities for editing and converting this format and will never be, 
unless ES supplies them. However, according to Matt Pritchard, the ES
graphics engine specialist, there is a high probability for that. So you
should wait for it to edit the graphics, and me to remove this sad 
paragraph from this text. As for the new Egyptian wonder graphic I used in
the "First Age of Empires Modpack", I took it from the data resource files
of the game - it was there, #30 in GRAPHICS.DRS, not used and unseen by 
nobody. There are several other like it that you could use for the same
purpose, but of course the possibilities are limited.

To do whatever customization you want, you need to know what to modify.
The files embedded in the .DRS files are identified by their type - 
.BIN, .SLP, .SHP or .WAV, and by integer numbers (file identifiers).
These numbers are of course not very descriptive by themselves. I'm currently
preparing a table containing the descriptions of most files from 
SOUNDS.DRS and GRAPHICS.DRS and some from INTERFAC.DRS. It will soon be 
available for download on the AoE Heaven and Telcontar's AoE sites, and 
will probably be included in the future DRSBUILD versions packages. 

The history of DRSBUILD is interesting. I didn't discovered the .DRS 
files format myself. I found a somewhat incomplete (and slightly incorrect)
description in the Telcontar's AoE site, written by Cyrille Artho and
Steve Chen. I was grabbed by the idea, so I filled the blanks in their 
description of the DRS format and wrote the first version of DRSBUILD. It 
contained a detailed description of the .DRS files format as I understood
it. It was pretty full except for a single mysterious byte. After that an 
email from Matt Pritchard (ES) clarified it all. His description is of 
course the most adequate one, but at least for now is considered a document 
to be used only by AoE utility developers. Since I had already written my 
own description, I simply slightly corrected it to make it full. It is 
provided in the file DRSFMT.TXT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's very simple. The original package is a ZIP archive called
DRSBLD11.ZIP, which contains the following files:

DRSBUILD.EXE 		- executable
DRSBUILD.TXT		- the file you are currently reading
MINSTALL.BAT		- sample modpack installation script
DRSFMT.TXT		- description of .DRS files format

After unzipping the archive, copy the executable to a location somewhere
in your PATH, so you can use it without specifying its full name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DRSBUILD is a command-line (console) utility. This means it's intended
to be run from a MS-DOS prompt, and with correct arguments. Don't try
to click it in the Windows Explorer - nothing will happen. Read the
description that follows to learn about the DRS commands and command-line 
switches.

Usage: DRSBUILD {/a | /r | /d | /e | /l | /h} <drs_file>[.DRS]
                [<file> ...] [/o <out_dir>] [/s]

Commands:
    /a  Add/replace files in <drs_file>
    /r  Replace files in <drs_file>
    /d  Delete files from <drs_file>
    /e  Extract files from <drs_file>
    /l  List files in <drs_file>
    /h  Print a help screen

Switches:
    /o  Extract files to <out_dir> folder, default is current folder
    /s  Silent mode

All commands (except "/h") work on one or more .DRS files which
must follow the command. This is the <drs_file> argument. It must be a
valid file specification for the Windows 95 operating system and can
contain "wildcards". These are the characters "*" or "?", where "?"
stands for "any character" and "*" stands for "zero or more any characters".
If <drs_file> is a filename (no wildcards) the .DRS extension can be
omitted, and the file is not required to exist if the "/a" command is
given - in this case a new .DRS file with the specified name is created.
If <drs_file> contains wildcards (e. g. "*.drs") then it should be
possible to be expanded to one or more existing .DRS files, even
if the "/a" command is given - in this case all commands work on all existing
.DRS files matching the specified wildcard argument.

Besides the command and the .DRS file(s), you can specify any number
of file specifications for the files which the command should process.
These are the <file> arguments. They can also contain wildcards
(e. g. "*.wav"). If "/a" or "/r" commands are given, the <file> arguments
are assumed to be existing external files which should be added to or 
replaced in the specified .DRS file(s). Otherwise, they are assumed to be 
"internal" files, i. e. contained within the specified .DRS file(s), which 
should be deleted, extracted or listed. If there are no <file> arguments given,
they assumed to be "*.*", i. e. all files in the current folder. If you 
don't know the filenames of the internal files, use DRSBUILD with the "/l" 
command to see them.

EXAMPLES:

To extract all files from the .DRS file INTERFAC.DRS, located in the
folder \GAMES\MSAOE\DATA to the INTERFAC\ type:

  DRSBUILD /e \games\MSAoE\data\interfac.drs /o interfac

To build the .DRS file INTERFAC.DRS in the current folder from all files in the
folder INTERFAC\ type:

  DRSBUILD /a interfac.drs interfac\*.*

To delete all .SHP files from the .DRS file INTERFAC.DRS in the current folder 
type - don't try the game with this version of INTERFAC.DRS :-) :

  DRSBUILD /d interfac.drs *.shp

To replace only the existing files in all .DRS files in the folder
\GAMES\MSAOE\DATA with the corresponding (matching file identifiers) files 
in the MY_MODPACK\ folder without adding new files type:

  DRSBUILD /r \games\MSAoE\data\*.drs my_modpack\*.*

To list all files in the DRS file INTERFAC.DRS, located in the current
folder, type:

  DRSBUILD /l interfac.drs

NOTE: If your files have long names with spaces, you should place them in "".

NOTE: In the older versions of DRSBUILD, the "Add/replace" command was
called "Build" command and the switch was "/b". It's still there and
works in the same manner as the "/a" switch. It is provided for
backward compatibility only.

The filenames of the files contained within a .DRS file can't be determined
from the .DRS file format. Each file is identified by an unique integer
number, which serves as an identifier for the file. When extracting or
listing, the filenames are constructed according to standard namespace 
rules in the following manner: the name contains 8 symbols, the first 3 of them 
being the same as the first three symbols of the .DRS filename, the next 5 
containing the file identifier, padded with zeros from the left if less than 
10000; the extension of course is ".BIN", ".SLP", ".SHP" and ".WAV" according
to the file type. For example, the wave file numbered 5148 from SOUNDS.DRS is 
named SOU05148.WAV. When adding an external file to a DRS file, DRSBUILD expects 
the file identifier in the last 5 symbols of the filename and the type in the 
extension, the first 3 letters being not important. That is you can replace
#5148 in SOUNDS.DRS with AOE05148.WAV or WAV05148.WAV, but not with SOU5148.WAV
or WHATEVER.WAV. If a non-compliant external filename is encountered, it's error. 
This is made on purpose, to prevent as much as possible the building of 
corrupted DRS files that could crash the game and hang the OS.

During the work of DRSBUILD, you'll see messages on the screen about the 
operation currently in progress. If an error occurs, a message is displayed 
and the program execution is stopped. Possible errors include failures to open, 
read from or write to some of the files that were specified, wrong usage, or 
attempt to use invalid input files or non-DRS files as targets. The type of the 
DRS files is determined from their extension and from their header. 
The extension of the DRS files must be always ".DRS".

No matter the command, the .DRS files are not required to reside in the AoE 
DATA\ folder. The output files are created in the current folder, unless 
otherwise specified in the <drs_file> argument and the "/o" switch. To use 
the .DRS files with AoE, you must copy them by hand to the DATA folder
where the game was installed. After doing so, simply start the game and
enjoy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRACTICE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

How you should practically use DRSBUILD to create or install modpacks?
These are two completely different tasks, the creation being a major
trouble for modpack developers, and the installation for modpack
users (or modpack developers when writing installation scripts for their
modpacks). I have therefore divided this section into two parts for these 
two tasks. Don't skip it, reading it can save you lots of trouble.

CREATING MODPACKS WITH DRSBUILD:

First of all, you need to determine what files you should change. You need 
to know the file identifier of each file in order to do this. Refer to the file 
DRSFILES.TXT (will be available in a few days for download) or some other 
description of the .DRS files contents to learn them. Each identifier corresponds 
to a given object or event, for example the Egyptian wonder graphic is #33 in 
GRAPHICS.DRS and the wonder selection event sound is #5148 in SOUNDS.DRS. If you 
replace some of the files in the .DRS files with files in the same format that 
the game expects for each particular file, that is .SLP for the graphics and .WAV 
for the sounds, the game will use the modified ones. In fact this is your chance 
to create modpacks.

If you want to take some of the standard files as a base for creating your own,
you must extract them from the .DRS files of the game first. Use DRSBUILD with 
the "/e" switch to do it. For example to extract all embedded files from all
.DRS files of the game (installed in the \GAMES\MSAOE folder) in the FILES 
folder type:

  DRSBUILD /e \games\MSAoE\data\*.drs /o files

Next you should edit the standard files, or create/obtain the files with which 
you them to be replaced. As for the sounds, you can take any .WAV file you want, 
record it or create it some other way. Be careful though - some sound editors
produce .WAV files in a slightly incompatible format, they do not crash the
game, but are never heard. The Windows 95 Sound Recorder appears to be such one. 
As this is the only "sound editor" I have, to create the "First Age of
Empires Modpack" I simply took the file "The Microsoft Sound.wav" from the 
WINDOWS\MEDIA folder, and it worked perfectly. The Steve's AoE Sound Editor
has some interesting features like making all sounds equally loud, etc. 
Download it from the Telcontar's site and try it. Since it modifies directly
SOUNDS.DRS, after finishing your modpack you should extract the modified sounds
form SOUNDS.DRS using DRSBUILD.

As for the graphics ... well, as I already said, you can't create or edit them 
for now, not before the appropriate utility is released by ES. This utility is
expected to convert .BMP or some other popular picture (or 3D modeling ?) 
format to .SLP and .SHP, and vice-versa. So you will probably soon be able to 
edit the graphics with popular tools and then convert them to .SLP. Till then
the only .SLP files you can use are the ones from the standard .DRS files - 
some of them are really beautiful but not used in the game, so you can make use 
of them. Please don't try to replace the archer graphics with catapult graphics,
this won't make archers shoot better :-)

When your new files are ready, copy all of them into one folder, let's say
named NEWFILES. Delete all standard files from it - you don't need to provide 
any files you have not modified. Then start renaming - if the names of your
files don't follow the standard namespace conventions used by DRSBUILD 
(see above) rename them, or else they can't be put into the .DRS files and tried.
After you have renamed your files, try them by executing DRSBUILD with 
a command-line like (backup your original .DRS files before executing this!):

  DRSBUILD /r \games\MSAoE\data\*.drs newfiles\*.slp newfiles\*.wav

Now start the game and see what you have done. For easier testing, you may 
need to create a sample scenario that should contain all objects you are
customizing. 

When you have finished editing and testing, write a short documentation on
how your modpack should be installed, or even better an installation script.
A standard installation script is provided in the file MINSTALL.BAT, you can
ship it along with your files or edit it to create a script that best suites
your needs. You can also ship DRSBUILD along with you files, provided that 
you supply this file also and in unmodified form. You are not required 
to supply with DRSBUILD any of the files DRSFMT.TXT and DRSFILES.TXT.

Now take all the files you want to provide - documentation, installation 
scripts, DRSBUILD files, sample scenarios and of course your new graphics and 
sounds, and zip them. You can zip them without the folder names and write a 
detailed description of what should be placed where. Or you can zip them with 
the folder names and require that the user unzips the package into the AoE 
installation folder preserving the folder structure, so that each file goes to 
its appropriate place. The recommended folder structure is:

    scenario\
        (scenarios)
    modpack\
        my_modpack\
            (new graphics & sounds)
    (documentation)
    (DRSUILD files - drsbuild.exe, drsbuild.txt)
    (installation scripts)

With this structure, the user should read the documentation (directly
from the archive), unpack the archive into his AoE installation folder,
run the installation script & enjoy.

INSTALLING MODPACKS WITH DRSBUILD:

Always backup your original .DRS files before replacing them with the 
new ones from the modpack! Even if the installation script does so
automatically, check what exactly it tries to do before running 
it, or better copy DATA\*DRS somewhere else and be safe!

The DRSBUILD command-line which actually installs the modpack should be 
like:

  DRSBUILD /r data\*.drs modpack\my_modpack\*.slp modpack\my_modpack\*.wav

when run from the AoE installation directory. The directory 
modpack\my_modpack is supposed to contain the new graphics & sounds of the
modpack.

The standard installation script MINSTALL.BAT should be always run from the
AoE installation directory with one argument - the name of the modpack you 
wish to install. This name must actually be the name of the folder under 
MODPACK\ folder where the modpack files reside. For the above example:

  MINSTALL my_modpack

To uninstall the modpack, run the uninstall script (if available) or simply
copy your backup-ed original *.DRS files into the DATA folder over the modified 
ones.

DANGEROUS COMMANDS

NEVER run DRSBUILD with the "/a" (add/replace) or the "/d" (delete)
commands unless you are pretty sure what you are doing! Especially don't
try this on the standard .DRS files, or if you do, don't expect the game to
work! These commands are dangerous, since their use can lead to .DRS files
with additional or missing file types and file identifiers. Only Heaven
knows what the game can do if started with such files, but hanging your system 
is the most probable outcome. Of course you can do this at your own risk and
if you find bugs in the work of these commands, your feedback will be highly
appreciated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- "Replace only" ("/r") command added - very useful for installing modpacks.
- "Delete" ("/d") command added.
- Added full wildcards support.
- Added "/o" switch for the output directory.
- Added "/s" switch for silent mode, default mode made "verbose".
- Documentation updated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS & LIMITATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For now none available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEEDBACK & SUPPORT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only important thing one can expect from such an utility like DRSBUILD
is: reliability. Or else it will not only make nobody happy, but could
really put many people into trouble. So if you suspect the least bug in the
work of DRSBUILD, please contact me! Your help will be highly appreciated.
I've tested DRSBUILD very carefully, but still I can't guarantee there are
no bugs left. I will check carefully every bug-reporting email I receive
and fix any bug I find.

I will try to keep up with the game and provide bug-fixes and future 
versions to anyone interested. They will be available on the AoE Heaven site 
at:

  http://age.gamestats.com/age/

and on the Telcontar's AoE site at:

  http://www.mordor.ch/user/cartho/age/
